This is a tutorial implemention of Deep Neural Decision Forests
(dNDF).The paper was published in ICCV(the Open Access vision,provided by
the Computer Vision Foundation).

Deep Neural Decision Forest,ICCV 2015,proposed a great way to incorporate a 
neural network with a decision forest.Durning the optimization,the terminal
(leaf)node has to be updated after each epoch.
